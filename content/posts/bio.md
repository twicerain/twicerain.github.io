###### My name
Hi, my name is Kye, or rainrain, and I'm a designer, primarily of the sound variety. I have collaborated with artists and labels to achieve millions of plays and thousands of monthly listeners on Spotify. I have experience with different creative industries through work and study, such as graphic design, photography & videography, digital 3D art and modelling, and game design including VR. This broad set of skills and experiences allows me a unique perspective for design, and ease collaborating with others in projects.

###### My passion
My passion in creative work is born of the problem solving process. I love tackling a new project and working out the most efficient way to solve a problem or meet a unique result & challenging goal, and the reward of finishing, leaving with new skills and ability. I am always studying and staying in touch with these evolving fields to ensure I can begin any project with the best base to launch from.

###### My success
In music, my success has come from Spotify under the alias "Awae", releasing a future bass track titled Hold Me, with Damned & Layna, and a solo remix as "rainrain". In working with photography and videography I was able to write a segment at the ABC in Adelaide called "The Strum", which provided local musicians an opportunity to cover their own music and promote upcoming events they would be involved in. I launched packages for businesses including a vineyard and a contruction resources company, involving logos, websites, and other assets.

###### My studies
During my studies so far I have recieved high distinction for grading top of my classes in analogue audio and electronics, virtual reality design and scoring 100% across assignments in 3D Imaging. At my previous university, SAE (School of Audio Engineering), a well-renown globally established institution, my music has been used as an example for following students.

###### My goal
I am continuing study at university and am focused on honing my skills in my fields to grow an edge in these competitive industries. My goal is to pursue a long lasting career in design.
