## Who Am I

Hi, my name is Kye, or rainrain, and I'm a designer, primarily of the sound variety. I have collaborated with artists and labels to achieve millions of plays and thousands of monthly listeners on Spotify. I have experience with different media industries through both work and study, such as graphic design, photography & videography, digital 3D art and modelling, and game design including VR. 

This broad set of skills and experience allows me a unique perspective for design, and ease collaborating with others in projects.

## My Passion

### In Work

My passion in creative work is born of the problem solving process. I love tackling a new project and working out the most efficient way to solve a problem or meet a unique result & challenging goal, and the reward of finishing, leaving with new skills and ability. 

I am always studying and staying in touch with these evolving fields to ensure I can begin any project with the best base to launch from.

### In Music

#### Listening

I listen to a wide variety of music with appreciation, although there are a few genres of music I always return to. The complex sounds and rhythm created by [Noisia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4YWj8sohRDjL9deiuRvEEY?si=4ZbWn9DcT86L5v5fVw0ZNA), and the soul and groove of artists like [Mr. Carmack](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4OHaWpWPKDcZgOOUn9elFn?si=cHhnPEs8S0SlrzpUwd2EJQ) and [Flying Lotus](https://open.spotify.com/artist/29XOeO6KIWxGthejQqn793).

#### Creating

In my own music I find the most joy from the initial wave of inspiration, where ever it comes from, that drowns the world out before I realise how much time has passed seeing where it leads - this is why I have over 100 tracks, but only a handful have been released.

Sound design has been my largest investment, and drives a lot of my musical interests.


## My Success

### In Music

Under the alias "[Awae](https://open.spotify.com/artist/07VDqLCbNS2LmFZikG2gMN)", I released a future bass track titled [Hold Me](https://open.spotify.com/track/0b666TbqplqFucDuXt5QNr?si=0b1e2df1f75a4e94), with [Damned](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4WMXcM72GpZ8smS39Op2nB) & [Layna](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1YXZEt2UeP9s5fVciblARQ), which currently has over 7 million plays on spotify alone. I later released a solo remix as "[Rainrain](https://open.spotify.com/artist/36NahICqAtxFX6oirqBTYM)" to bring the track arc to an end with my new brand.

I have collaborated with other artists since then and also contributed to works, without credit, for larger studios.

### In Television

In photography and videography I wrote a TV segment, at the [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/) for C44 in Adelaide, called "The Strum". The show provided local musicians an opportunity to cover their own music in a live or acoustic format and promote upcoming events they would be involved in.

I directed the shots, recorded the audio, wrote the scripts and created the motion graphics for the show, covering almost everything, including the intro soundtrack for the show.

### In Graphic Design

Working as a graphic designer I launched asset packages and websites for businesses, including a vineyard and a contruction resources company. My package usually involved everything from logos, websites and style guides, to email footers and company statements.

I also spent some time working alongside a team designing marketing and business material for a venue.

## My studies

### Diploma of Sound Production

In 2014, at age 17, I attended University at [SAE](https://sae.edu.au/), (School of Audio Engineering, a well-renown globally established institution), graduating in 2015. During my time there I was able to utilise industry leading audio equipment in recording, surround sound and mixing. I was given the opportunity to gain experience mixing in a live stage environment, and learn from industry professionals.

### Bachelor of Media (Sonic Arts)

I am currently studying for degree at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). During my studies so far I have recieved high distinctions, grading at top of my classes in analogue audio and electronics, virtual reality design and for scoring 100% across assignments in 3D Imaging. It has provided me with core theory for analysis and the efficient, educated production of content.

Completion is set for 2024 at which point I am looking into further study in the fields of immersive media and asset production.

## My goal

I am continuing study at university, focused on honing my skills in my fields to grow and keep an edge in these competitive industries. My goal is to pursue a long lasting career in design.
