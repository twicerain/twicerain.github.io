## Introduction

I wanted to write a post about keeping ambitions realistic, drawing on my recent experience creating this app,
and leading to why I eventually decided to use [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) to do so.

This is an area I struggle with and so this post is for myself just as much as anyone else who it might arrive at helpfully.

## What Are Realistic Goals?

A realistic goal could be thought of as a goal with majority odds of success.

### Criteria

Perhaps to begin with, we should think about what criteria contribute to make a goal realistic:

1. Achievable within a given timeframe
2. Within your ability
3. Motivated to stick to it
4. Accounts for potential issues

Of course, we can't be sure of knowing _exactly_ what is achievable within any given timeframe, and 
perhaps your ability will grow through the process, or your motivation will falter.

Certainly, accounting for every potential problem that may arise is not possible at all.
Setting out to do so would be an unreasonable goal on its own.

### Approaching These Criteria

Let's reword the criteria as an approach for meeting them.

1. Aim to finish in advance
2. Keep the project grounded
3. Break it down into smaller steps
4. Create a backup plan

Looking at it this way helps us understand the parameters of a realistic goal in advance :fire:.

## Who Does This Apply to?

I think everyone stands to benefit from taking a step back from their goals and aspirations with an analytic eye.
Some people more than others, and like I've mentioned, this is a problem I am often faced with.

I think in freelance, media and creative industries this can be more prominent as it can be an individual problem.
But in all areas of life or industry,
we can benefit from taking time to think things all the way through before we begin to tackle them.

## What if We Don't Plan Appropriately?

I couldn't count the stressful late nights I have spent dreading an upcoming deadline,
in work, in study, and in my personal life too.

When this happens, and we scramble to assemble an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) from our _incredible,
amazing, beautiful, **unfinished**_ dream project,
we are often left with a sense of defeat and disappointment.
This can certainly destroy motivation and set us up in a negative way.

Would it not be better to arrive at the MVP first,
and only following that set to making it incredible, amazing, and beautiful?
In such a scenario we can at the very least do our best to ensure that it will exist in a finished state.

## Building My Website

[This website](https://rainrain.io/) is my most recent and perfect example of what can happen with inefficent planning,
or getting overly ambitious.

Recently I found myself with a few weeks of free time during semester break,
and so I decided I should finally put together a personal website.

### Week 1/3

My initial plan was for it to be a completely interactive 3D web experience with all the bells and whistles,
using ThreeJS.
However, first I had to learn the fundamentals of Javascript and ThreeJS,
so I began with [Codecademy's Javascript crash course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

_1 week down, I now only have 2 weeks left._

### Week 2/3

Now with only two weeks left and tension building,
I considered rather than fully interactive, I could create a 3D scene to use as a banner and navigation menu.

I decided I'll start by making some detailed models using blender and substance painter,
and that I might as well add animations and aim for "perfect subsurf topology" with all the bells and whistles.
I finished only my [phone design] for the contact page link, after a week.  

_2 weeks down. Only 1 week left._

### Week 3/3

As you are reading this on my website,
you've no doubt noticed that there is no portfolio page,
let alone interactive 3D experiences.

With one week left, I decided that I needed to take a step back and start with a more _realistic goal_.
After reconsidering, I realised I don't need a portfolio for audio and images when [services for that](https://rainrain.io/links/) already exist.

As a result of that, I now have a website.
It doesn't have all the bells and whistles,
but it exists, and it does exactly what I initially set out to achieve:
to _put together a personal website_.

## Why is it so Important

Considering the above, what is something we can determine.
That it took me _three weeks_ to finish something that only took _a few days_ of work.

Another way to look at it is that without proper planning, instead of setting yourself up for success,
you set yourself up for failure. Why would we not _aim to achieve what is achievable_?

It is as if there is a part of us that to aims for us to fail.
This is a common concept known as self-sabotage,
which should be enough to lead you to further research and discussion on the topic.
From [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/self-sabotage):
{{< admonition type=quote >}}
self-sabotage refers to behaviours or thought patterns that hold you back and prevent you from doing what you want to do.
{{< /admonition >}}


During my research for this post, I also came across this saying from a dialect of Chinese:
{{< admonition type=quote title="Kiang Tio Ho Mai Keh Kiang." >}}
When translated: "It is good to be smart, but donâ€™t be overly smart and do extra things."
{{< /admonition >}}

_Does this mean I shouldn't try hard, or I should do the bare minimum?_

If I had finished my website in the first week of my break,
I would have had 2 weeks on top of that to _refine_ the finished product.
I still can add an interactive banner at the top of my homepage,
or even a completely interactive version of the site.

But now I don't _need_ to, to reach a publishable product,
and imagine all the space I could have preserved in my head,
if I didn't fill it up with Javascript :nauseated_face:.

## Strategies & Tools to Help Us

To reduce our scope creep and grand self-expectations to something more grounded we can attempt to utilise some strategies.

### Strategies

The following is not a definitive list,
they are points I have been taught, discovered or that I have found through writing this post.

#### 1. Write lists

This one I have been an avid practitioner of, as of recently.
I can only recommend it, especially if you find yourself overwhelmed with the task at hand.

It has become incorporated in my daily life towards all aspects, study, work and personal.

#### 2. Spend more time thinking about it than you expect

I found an interesting example of this,
from the most recent 1-month challenge issued by Clinton (Pwnisher) Jones named Moving Meditations.

As a part of challenge, he provided a timeline to help guide your progress,
in which, of the 4 weeks provided, the entire first week was set aside simply for planning.

#### 3. Consider alternate options

Even when you think you have the perfect idea,
take some extra time to consider and follow through planning some alternate ideas.

This can help prevent a change of heart once you have begun.

#### 4. Consider having a backup plan

Following on from #3,
and with the criteria of accounting for potential issues.
Choose something simple to fall back on.

If something happens to prevent you from completing the project in time along with your goals,
or if your initial goals were not as realistic as you first thought,
this could help to prevent complete failure.

#### 5. Analyse your past projects and goals

As with everything we can reinforce our experience and learnings through reflection.
Analysing your past experience in this case can help provide a better understanding of how long you will actually need.

#### 6. Examine other people's works

If you can find other works similar to your own and own ability,
and see if you can find out what their general timeframe was.

You might also gain a grounded understanding of what is possible within the timeframe,
or what degree of product is expected of you.

#### 7. Be honest with yourself

Simple, but not always easy, and worthy of reminder every once in a while.

Do you _really_ know how to make a fully 3D interactive website? _Do you_...

#### 8. Block outs

Artists will use block outs to guide them before they begin to lay paint or detail.
This can be used as an analogy for any other aspect of life or work.

Creating a rough cut, giving it a test, or even just a practice go before committing completely.

#### 9. Staging

Setting smaller goals for in between can help you to understand if you're behind schedule before it's too late.
Most importantly in my case, it helps to provide boosts in motivation and help the project feel less looming.

#### 10. Enjoy the planning stage

It might be simple to form a good habit, by repetitively doing the good thing,
but it is much more difficult to break a bad habit.

Give yourself time and patience to break the habits you have formed for years and when you do,
the planning part might become just as enjoyable as following through, if not more so.

{{< admonition type="tip">}}If I could recommend some [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations),
stoic philosophers understood well the power of habit.
If you can get used to spending time thinking and planning out each aspect of a project or task before beginning,
you might begin to enjoy the process.{{< /admonition >}}

### Tools

I have tried and tested many different tools to help me follow the strategies set above.
The following have stuck by and have had me repeatedly fall back to for anything from life, work, and study.

#### 1. Obsidian

The beautiful thing about [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), the framework I used to build this website,
is that it relies on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

What I love about Markdown is the constraints forces your hand into a logical formatting style,
with a focus on conciseness.
It translates really well as a tool for planning,
and helps to bring your thoughts through to their logical conclusions.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is an app for using markdown to create notes with community plugins,
customisability with CSS and a beautiful node tree visualiser. 

#### 2. Pureref

Pureref is an app that allows for creating inspirational mood and reference boards for visual application.
It has a sleek interface with a focus on shortcuts for a resulting workflow that is completely non-distracting.

#### 3. Sheets

[Sheets](https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/) is a web based,
spreadsheet app like excel which can be a great tool for keeping track of things in almost any application.

You can use it to track shots, recordings, sounds, timelines, tasks or even just write a shopping list.
Its functionality is so powerful and I am not the one to try to explain it in any detail.
I definitely recommend you check it out as when used properly it is incredible for efficiency.

#### 4. Journal

As simple as it gets, either a notebook, diary, journal, or scrap pieces of paper can do the job just fine.

I have incorporated a notebook similar to [this one](https://www.amazon.com.au/Full-Focus-Executive-Planner-Michael/dp/1732189641/ref=sr_1_13?crid=3FI68SKUP3DC5&keywords=leather+planner&qid=1660897229&sprefix=leather+planner%2Caps%2C239&sr=8-13)
in my daily life alongside the other tools I have mentioned.

{{< admonition >}}As for the exact use case for each depends entirely on what you're working on,
or what aspects of your life, work or study you are looking to apply these realistic goals to.

My use cases have developed from use, after trying different services,
and different applications of tools before I found a system that worked for me.
Keep going until something works for you too :tada:. {{< /admonition >}}

### Discussion

{{< admonition type=info open=false >}}
With my portfolios hosted on other services,
this blog is designed to be used for discussion taken a step back from the technical details of my work.
{{< /admonition >}}

For an in-depth look at how I approached a project and the technicalities behind it,
you can find them on the relevant portfolio website, links for all of which can be found [here](https://rainrain.io/links/).
