# Timeline

## Week 1

_(June 30 - August 6)_

- [x] Read the rules!
- [x] Read through the FAQ to see if some of your initial questions have already been answered.
- [x] Download the supplied template files.
- [x] Make sure to look through all of the animations before choosing yours. You never know when inspiration will strike. FOCUS ON YOUR IDEA. It's ideal to come up with many different concepts as it's easier to change them now rather than later.
- [x] Make some thumbnails exploring different compositions. These should be easily understandable from varying distances and sizes.
- [x] Double check your file settings, especially FPS, to make sure it complies with the rules. You don't want to have your frame range and animations not lining up properly.
- [ ] If you are planning on having motion blur or simulations, adding sufficient pre-roll frames is highly recommended to avoid issues on the first frame of your animation.
- [ ] Finalize your idea.
- [ ] List the assets you're going to need.
- [x] Do a basic layout matching your finalized thumbnail (Grey-boxing, "visual weight" check).

## Week 2

_(August 7 - 13)_

- [ ] Start asset and character creation.
- [ ] Finalize base model of your character. (This is to ensure you're using an accurate proxy for initial simulations and animation tests. You will more than likely replace this later on with a more refined version)
- [ ] Attach you base character to your selected animation.
- [ ] Start simulations. (ex. Clothing, Fluids, etc...)
- [ ] Start lighting, texturing, and creating shaders for assets as they are completed.

## Week 3

_(August 14 - 20)_

- [ ] Add elements such as Depth of Field, Fog, and Motion Blur. (**Render Intensive:** temporarily added to check render times.)
- [ ] Do a test render frame of your scene. Pick particularly resource intensive frames from the start, middle, and end to ensure consistency. (ex. Wrong Camera, Frozen Animations, General Oddities)
- [ ] Finalize all of your asset creation, texturing, lighting, and simulating. This is to ensure you have plenty of time to find and fix issues.
- [ ] Start a render of your entire scene. (If you know your render is particularly heavy, it may be worth lowering some settings at this point to make sure you can render and complete version.)

## Week 4

_(August 21 - 27)_

- [ ] Double check your test render has no visual issues. This is to ensure that a fully rendered version of your rendered frames are complete.
- [ ] Complete final compositing, color correction, and grading for your submission
- [ ] TRIPLE CHECK EVERYTHING AGAIN! Your file format, framerate, and total frame count are correct. Ask friends, walk through the Rules and FAQ step by step. It would suck to come this far and fumble across the finish line.
