## Setting Realistic Goals & Building rainrain.io

I wanted to write a post about keeping ambitions realistic, drawing on my recent experience creating this platform, and leading to why I eventually decided to use Hugo to do so.
This is an area I struggle with myself frequently and so this writing is for myself just as much as anyone else who it might arrive at helpfully.

### What Are Realistic Goals?

A realistic goal could be thought of as a goal with majority odds of success.

#### Criteria

Perhaps to begin with, we should think about what criteria would make a goal realistic:

1. Achievable within the timeframe
2. Within your ability
3. Motivated to stick to it
4. Accounts for potential issues with time

Ofcourse, we cant be sure of knowning _exactly_ what is achievable within any given timeframe before beginning. 
Perhaps your ability will grow through the process, or your motivation will fail.
Certainly accounting for every potential problem that could arise is not possible at all.

#### Approaching These Criteria

Maybe, rewording the criteria as an approach toward our goal can help us further.

1. Aim to finish in advance
2. Keep the project simple and easy
3. Break it down into smaller steps
4. Create a backup plan

This helps us understand the parameters of a realistic goal in advance :fire:.

### Why is it So Important

I think everyone stands to benefit from taking a step back from their goals and aspirations with an analytic eye.
Some people more than others, and like I've mentioned, this is a problem I am often faced with.

I think in freelance, media and creative industries this can be more frequent as it can be an individual problem. But in all areas of life or industry, we can benefit from taking time to think things all the way through before we begin to tackle them.

### What if We Don't Plan?

I couldnt count how many sleepless nights I have spent dreading an upcoming deadline, in work, in study, and in my personal life too.
When this happens, and we scramble to assemble an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) from our _incredible, amazing, beautiful **unfinished**_ dream project,
we are left with a sense of defeat and disappointment.

This can certainly destroy motivation and set us up in a negative way.

#### Building My Website

This website is my most recent and perfect example of why it could be seen as so important.

Recently I found myself with a few weeks of unplanned time during semester break,
and so I decided I should finally put together a personal website.

##### Week 1

My initial plan was for it to be a completely interactive 3D website experience with all the bells and whistles, using ThreeJS.
Ofcourse first I had to learn the fundamentals of Javascript and ThreeJS. 

_Okay, 1 week down, I now only have 2 weeks left._

##### Week 2

Now with only two weeks, I considered instead of fully interactive I would create a 3D scene to use as a banner and navigation menu. 
I'll make some highly detailed low poly models using blender and substance painter, with animations and all the bells and whistles.
If I'm already making some models I should model them for sub-surf and deformation, using perfect topology, and put them on an asset market too.
Ofcourse, I finished my phone design for the contact page.

_Okay, 2 weeks down. Only 1 week left._

##### Week 3

As you're reading this on my website, you've no doubt noticed that there is no portfolio to be seen, let alone interactive 3D experiences.
I am so happy for it. 

With one week left, I decided that I needed to take a step back, and start with a more [realistic goal].
As a result of that, I now have a website. It doesnt have all the bells and whistles,
but it exists, and it does exactly what I initally set out to achieve - to _put together a personal website_.

#### Results

So considering the above, what can we determine.
That it took me _**three weeks**_ to finish something that only took _**a few days**_ of work.

Another way to look at it is, instead of setting yourself up for success,
you set yourself up for failure. Why would we not aim to achieve what is achievable?
It's as if there is a part of being human that to drives us to fail. This is a common concept known as self-sabotage, which should be enough to lead you further to research and discussion on the topic. From healthline - self-sabotage refers to behaviors or thought patterns that hold you back and prevent you from doing what you want to do.

During my research for this post I came across this saying from Chinese,
>Kiang Tio Ho Mai Keh Kiang.
When translated, "It is good to be smart, but donâ€™t be overly smart and do extra things."

So does this mean I shouldn't try hard, or I should do the bare minimum? If I had finished my website in the first week of my break, I would have had 2 weeks on top of that to _refine_ the finished product. I could still add an interactive banner at the top of my homepage, or a completely interactive version of the site. But now I dont _**need**_ to, and imagine all the room in my head Id have if I didnt fill it up with Javascript :nauseated_face:.

### How Can We Combat it?

In order to reduce our scope creep and etc etc

#### Strategies

The following is not a definitive list, and I am not claiming to be a perfect example of practicing it. They are points I have been taught, discovered or I have found through writing this post.

**1. Write lists**

_This one I have been an avid practicer of as of recently. I can only recommend it, and it has become incorporated in my daily life towards all aspects, study, work and personal._

**2. Spend more time thinking about it than you expect.**

_An interesting example of this for me was from the most recent 1 month challenge issued by Clinton (Pwnisher) Jones named Moving Meditations. As a part of challenge he provided a timeline to help guide your progress, in which of the 4 weeks the entire first week was set aside simply for planning._

**3. Consider alternate options.**

_Even when you think you have the perfect idea, take some extra time to consider and follow through planning some alternate ideas. This can help prevent a change of heart once you've begun._

**4. Consider having a simpler backup plan.**

_Similar to #3, and to follow with the criteria of accounting for potential issues. Choose something simple to fall back on. If something happens to prevent you from completing the project in time along with your goals, or if your initial goals were not as realistic as your thought, this could help to prevent complete failure.

**5. Analyse your past projects and goals**

_As with everything, analysing your past experience in this case can help provide a better understanding of how long you actually need._

**6. Examine other peoples works.**

_If you can find other works similar to your own and own ability, and see if you can find out what their general timeframe was.

**7. Be honest with yourself.**

_Simple but perhaps not easy._

**8. Block outs**

_Artists will use blockouts to guide them when they begin to lay paint or detail. This can be used as an analagy to any aspect of life or work for creating a rough cut or giving it a test before committing._

**9. Staging**

_Setting smaller goals inbetween can help you understand if you're behind schedule before its too late. Most importantly it can help provide boosts in motivation and help the project feel less looming._

**10. Enjoy the planning stage**

_If I could recommend some reading, the greek philosophers understood well the power of habit. If you can get used to spending time thinking and planning out each aspect of a project or task before beginning, you will begin to enjoy the process._

_It might be simple to form a good habit - repetitively do the right thing - but it is much more difficult to break a bad habit. Give yourself time and patience to break the habits you have formed for years and when you do, the planning part might become just as enjoyable as following through, if not moreso._
