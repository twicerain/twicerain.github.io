## [Posts]({{% ref "/posts" %}})

Here you will find posts including tutorials or guides, thoughts and discussion, breakdowns of projects and the processes I went through. This will be a more casual though breakdown and thought process, for more technical breakdowns visit the relevant website found on this page.

## Music

### [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/twicerain)

On my soundcloud you can expect to find music I have released publicly any of my past aliases or current. If enough projects build up involving sound design, sound tracks for visual and interactive media etc, I will make a new soundcloud to share the audio.

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/36NahICqAtxFX6oirqBTYM)

I have two spotify accounts currently, one under my past alias as Awae, and a new one as Rainrain. You will generally find my most recent releases, and less music than what is avaliable on my soundcloud.
