# Platforms

## Posts

Here you will find [posts]({{% ref "/posts" %}}) including tutorials or guides, thoughts and discussion, breakdowns of projects and the processes I went through. This will be a more casual though breakdown and thought process, for more technical breakdowns visit the relevant website found on this page.

## Music

### Soundcloud

On my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/twicerain) you can expect to find music I have released publicly any of my past aliases or current. If enough projects build up involving sound design, sound tracks for visual and interactive media etc, I will make a new soundcloud to share the audio.

### Spotify

I have two [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/36NahICqAtxFX6oirqBTYM) accounts currently, one under my past alias as Awae, and a new one as Rainrain. You will generally find my most recent releases, and less music than what is avaliable on my soundcloud.
